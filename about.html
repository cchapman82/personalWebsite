    <h1>Hello!  I am Christopher</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>     I was born and raised in New Mexico.  While I love the land of enchatment, I wanted to 
        experience a more fast paced lifestyle with more diversity.  These inspirations gave me some
        wanderlust and decided to move to Chicago, where I lived for fourteen years.  My interrests 
        have been quite varied and have pursued many different paths from research to hospitality.  I 
        have always wanted to futher my education and learn new things.  I have immersed myself in 
        academics as well as fine arts and have a deep love of plants.
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>        Through my graduate studies, I developed comprehensive skills in systems and software 
        development, including distributed systems, concurrent programming, and database management.  
        I have hands-on experience with various architectural patterns such as model-view-controller,
        factory, and event-driven designs across both object-oriented and functional programming 
        aradigms. My approach to development emphasizes scalability, code reuse, and 
        maintainabilityâ€”principles that align with modern software engineering best practices. 
    <br>
    <p>
            My practical experience spans the full spectrum of data management, from entry and 
        reconciliation to maintenance, integration, and transfer across both research and commercial 
        environments. Additionally, my background in customer service has strengthened my communication 
        skills and ability to translate complex requirements into actionable technical solutions while 
        leveraging team strengths effectively.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
            What sets me apart is my commitment to collaborative development and continuous learning. 
        I understand that innovative software solutions emerge from diverse team perspectives and effective 
        communication. I am particularly excited to expand my technical skills, learn new implementation 
        strategies, and contribute to cutting-edge projects.
