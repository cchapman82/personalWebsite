    <h1>Hello!  I am Christopher</h1>
    <div class="aboutBody">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> 
                Born and raised in New Mexico, I spent over a decade in Chicago exploring new perspectives and 
            embracing a faster-paced, more diverse lifestyle. Now back home, I’m excited to start a new chapter
             focused on creative growth, collaboration, and continuous learning.
        </p>
        <p>     My background is multidisciplinary, spanning research, hospitality, and technology. I hold a 
            graduate degree in computer science, with a focus on systems and software development. My experience
             includes distributed systems, concurrent programming, and database management, as well as 
             architectural patterns like MVC, factory, and event-driven design—applied across both object-oriented 
            and functional paradigms.
        </p>
        <p>
                I also bring hands-on experience in full-cycle data management and a strong foundation in customer 
            service. These experiences have sharpened my communication skills and ability to bridge technical and 
            non-technical teams effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
                I’m passionate about thoughtful design, collaborative problem-solving, and learning new tools and 
            technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy engaging with the fine arts and caring for an ever-growing 
            collection of plants.
        </p>
